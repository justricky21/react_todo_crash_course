This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# React Crash Course - 2019
## Todo List app

This application was built following the 2019 [React Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBws8MSXN7A).

The purpose of this was to learn:

- Building and using class components;
- State and lifecycle;
- JSX;
- Event handling;
- Prop drilling.

## Goal

This app was taught under the instruction of Brad Traversy, with the intent of solidifying the React knowledge I garnered from CodeClan, as it was taken months after I completed the course.

This is a simple app, and will not be hosted for perusing. A full stack MERN app will be developed soon (when it is, I'll update this readme ðŸ˜ƒ)
